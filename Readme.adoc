= Stream Reader
Fran√ßois Lamboley <fload@me.com>

A simple stream reader protocol for Swift named `StreamReader`, with two
concrete implementations: `GenericStreamReader` and `DataReader`.

The `GenericStreamReader` can read from any `GenericReadStream`, which the
`FileDescriptor` (from https://github.com/apple/swift-system[SystemPackage]),
`FileHandle` and `IntputStream` classes have been made to conform to.

== Usage Examples
=== Reading a Stream to the End
[source,swift]
----
let data = ...
let reader = DataReader(data: data)
let readData = try reader.readDataToEnd()
assert(readData == data)
----

=== Reading a Stream Until a Delimitor Is Found
[source,swift]
----
let inputStream = ...
let reader = InputStreamReader(stream: inputStream, bufferSize: 1024, bufferSizeIncrement: 512)
/* Read the stream until a newline (whether macOS or Classic MacOS) is found, and returns the data without the newline. */
let (line, separator) = try reader.readData(upTo: [Data("\n".utf8), Data("\r".utf8)], matchingMode: .anyMatchWins, failIfNotFound: false, includeDelimiter: false)
_ = try reader.readData(size: separator.count) /* We must read the line separator before next read, probably :) */
----

Note: In the example above, if the file has Windows new lines, this will add an
empty new line after each line (the separator for Windows being `\r\n`).

Stream Reader has also a dedicated method to read a line in a stream:
[source,swift]
----
/* Does not return the line separator, _but_ set stream position after the line separator. */
let lineData = try reader.readLine(allowUnixNewLines: true, allowLegacyMacOSNewLines: true, allowWindowsNewLines: true).line
----

== TODO
Make the reads async? This would change a lot of things, but the core of the
project should stay the same.

Or maybe just be thread-safe, idk.
