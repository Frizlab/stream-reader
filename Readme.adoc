= SimpleStream
Fran√ßois Lamboley <fload@me.com>

A simple stream protocol for Swift named `SimpleStream`, with two concrete implementations:
`SimpleGenericReadStream` and `SimpleDataStream`.

The `SimpleGenericReadStream` can read from any `GenericReadStream`, which the
`FileHandle` and `IntputStream` classes have been made conform to.

== Usage Examples
=== Reading a Stream to the End
[source,swift]
----
let ds = SimpleDataStream(data: d)
let rd = try ds.readDataToEnd()
assert(rd == d)
----

### Reading a Stream Until a Delimitor Is Found
[source,swift]
----
let s = SimpleInputStream(stream: yourInputStream, bufferSize: 1024, bufferSizeIncrement: 512, streamReadSizeLimit: nil)
/* Read the stream until a newline (whether macOS or Classic Mac OS) is found,
 * does not include the newline in the result. */
let line = try s.readData(upTo: [Data("\n".utf8), Data("\r".utf8)], matchingMode: .anyMatchWins, includeDelimiter: false).data
/* Note: If the file has Windows new lines, this will add an empty new line
 *       after each line (the separator for Windows being "\r\n"). */
----

== TODO
Make the reads async! This will change a lot of things, but the core of the project should stay the same.
